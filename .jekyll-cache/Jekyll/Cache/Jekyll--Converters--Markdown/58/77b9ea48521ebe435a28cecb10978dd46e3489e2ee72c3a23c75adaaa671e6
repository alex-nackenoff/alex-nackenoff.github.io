      This card gets 5% cash back in rotating quarterly categories (current categories <a href="https://creditcards.chase.com/freedom-credit-cards/calendar">here</a>, and previous year <a href="https://www.creditcardinsider.com/blog/chase-freedom-cash-back-categories/">example</a>) limited to $1,500 in purchases per quarter, in the form of Ultimate Rewards Points (UR). If you use my <a href="https://www.referyourchasecard.com/2f/3GYHBTXTXR">referral link</a>, you'll get a $200 sign-up bonus when you spend $500 within the first 3 months of receiving the card.

          <li>
          This card gets unlimited 1x points back (2x at grocery stores), in the form of Membership Rewards Points (MR). If you use my <a href="http://refer.amex.us/ALEXaNj0a1?XLINK=MYCP">referral link</a>, you'll get a 10,000 point sign-up bonus when you spend $1000 within the first 3 months of receiving the card. If you tend to use one card for everything, this card will earn a 20% bonus on everything that month (potential 2.4x points at grocery stores). This isn't the best card by itself, but rather a good free MR earning card, especially when paired with the Amex Gold. If you're a pure cash back person, you're better off going with the Blue Cash Everyday ($150 sign up bonus after $1000 of spend: 3% back at grocery stores, 2% at department stores, and 2% back at gas stations)
